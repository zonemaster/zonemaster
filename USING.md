# Zonemaster users guide

The purpose of the Zonemaster project is to develop a DNS validation software.
There are three ways one can use the Zonemaster software:

   * Using the Web user Interface: In this case, there is no installation of the
     Zonemaster software needed. A user types the URL
     [zonemaster.net](https://www.zonemaster.net), provides as input a domain
     name, and then can view the results.
   * From the Command Line Interface (CLI): In this case, the user has to
     install two components of the Zonemaster software, i.e. the
     "zonemaster-engine" and the "zonemaster-cli". Reference for installing
     these two components can be found from the [readme document](README.md).
   * There are cases, wherein an organisation or a user, that wants to have the
     results of their DNS validation stored and can be viewed later. In that
     case, in addition to the "zonemaster-engine" and "zonemaster-cli", the user has
     to install the "zonemaster-backend" and the "zonemaster-gui". Reference for
     installing in all these components can be found in the [readme document](README.md).
