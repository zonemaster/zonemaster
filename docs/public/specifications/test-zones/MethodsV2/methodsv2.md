## Background

See the [test zone README file] which is for test case base test zones. Since
this document specifies test zones for a [MethodsV2] Method, it is not fully
applicable.

## Test scenarios

The purpose of the test scenarios is to cover all reasonable contexts for the
Methods. See [the implementation of the scenarios] for the latest version of the
implementation of the MethodsV2 scenarios.


## Public methods

[MethodsV2] provides the following public methods:

* For parent zone:
  * Get parent NS IP addresses
* For delegation:
  * Get delegation NS names and IP addresses
  * Get delegation NS IP addresses
  * Get delegation NS names
* For zone information:
  * Get zone NS names and IP addresses
  * Get zone NS names
  * Get zone NS IP addresses

### Data type

All methods can return one of the following data types:
  * Empty set
  * Non-empty set
  * Undefined set

The non-empty set from the following methods consists of unique IP addresses,
IPv4, IPv6 or both (e.g "127.40.4.21" and "fda1:b2:c3::21" are valid):
  * Get parent NS IP addresses
  * Get delegation NS IP addresses
  * Get zone NS IP addresses
  
The non-empty set from the following methods consists of unique name server
names (e.g. "ns1.example.xa" and "ns2.example.xb" are valid):
  * Get delegation NS names
  * Get zone NS names

The non-empty set from the following methods consists of unique pairs of name
server name and its IP address (IPv4 or IPv6). The IP address can be left blank
(e.g. "ns1.example.xa/127.40.4.21", "ns1.example.xa/fda1:b2:c3::21" and
"ns1.example.xa" are valid):
  * Get delegation NS names and IP addresses
  * Get zone NS names and IP addresses

### Data defined for the scenarios

Both *Get delegation NS IP addresses* and *Get delegation NS names* can be
derived from *Get delegation NS names and IP addresses*.

Both *Get zone NS IP addresses* and *Get zone NS names* can be derived from
*Get zone NS names and IP addresses*.

Consequently, for the scenarios defined in this document the expected data is only
defined for the following three methods:
  * Get parent NS IP addresses
  * Get delegation NS names and IP addresses
  * Get zone NS names and IP addresses


## Test zone name

The test zone for each test scenario in this document is a subdomain delegated
from the base name (`methodsv2.xa`) and that subdomain having the same name as
the specific scenario. The names of those zones are given in section
"[Zone setup for test scenarios]" below.


## Zone setup for test scenarios

Assumptions for the scenario specifications unless otherwise specified for
the specific scenario:

* The child zone is `child.parent.SCENARIO.methodsv2.xa`.
  * It is served by two IB (in-bailiwick) NS (ns1 and ns2).
  * ns1 and ns2 have the same zone content.
  * ns1 and ns2 have both IPv4 and IPv6 glue.
  * The records matching glue in the zone are complete.
  * The delegation from the parent has the same NS with complete glue.
* The parent zone is `parent.SCENARIO.methodsv2.xa`.
  * It is served by two IB NS (ns1 and ns2).
  * ns1 and ns2 have the same zone content.
  * ns1 and ns2 have both IPv4 and IPv6 glue.
  * The records matching glue in the zone are complete.
  * The delegation from the grandparent has the same NS with complete glue.
* The grandparent zone is `SCENARIO.methodsv2.xa`.
  * It is served by two IB NS (ns1 and ns2).
  * ns1 and ns2 have the same zone content.
  * ns1 and ns2 have both IPv4 and IPv6 glue.
  * The records matching glue in the zone are complete.
  * The delegation from the SCENARIO zoen has the same NS with complete glue.
* Responds with a A record for the zone on query for A.
* Responds with a AAAA record for the zone on query for AAAA.
* All responses are authoritative with [RCODE Name] "NoError".
* EDNS, version 0, is included in all responses on queries with EDNS.
* EDNS is not included in responses on queries without EDNS.
* Standard root is used.
* In all cases, delegation and zone are consistent.
  * Same NS
  * Any required glue matches address records in zone. No extra address
    records.

Zone is delegated to two OOB NS, of which one has no IP (NXDOMAIN).

* Zone: child.parent.deleg-oob-w-error-2.methodsv2.xa
  * Zone is delegated to `ns3.deleg-oob-w-error-2.methodsv2.xa` and
    `ns4-nxdomain.deleg-oob-w-error-2.methodsv2.xa`.
  * `ns3` is fully functional with the zone which matches the
    delegation.
  * `ns4-nxdomain` cannot be resolved (NXDOMAIN).

### DELEG-OOB-W-ERROR-3
Zone is delegated to two OOB NS, where both have no IP (NODATA).

* Zone: child.parent.deleg-oob-w-error-3.methodsv2.xa
  * Zone is delegated to `ns3-nodata.deleg-oob-w-error-3.methodsv2.xa` and
    `ns4-nodata.deleg-oob-w-error-3.methodsv2.xa`.
  * `ns3-nodata` and `ns4-nodata` cannot be resolved (NODATA).
  * There is no child zone.

### DELEG-OOB-W-ERROR-4
Zone is delegated to two OOB NS, where both have no IP (NXDOMAIN).

* Zone: child.parent.deleg-oob-w-error-4.methodsv2.xa
  * Zone is delegated to `ns3-nxdomain.deleg-oob-w-error-4.methodsv2.xa` and
    `ns4-nxdomain.deleg-oob-w-error-4.methodsv2.xa`.
  * `ns3-nxdomain` and `ns4-nxdomain` cannot be resolved (NXDOMAIN).
  * There is no child zone.

### CHILD-NS-CNAME-1
Zone is delegated to two IB NS, where both NS names are aliases (CNAME)
to other names in zone.

* child.parent.child-ns-cname-1.methodsv2.xa
  * Zone is delegated to `ns1-cname` and `ns2-cname` and both are aliases to
    `ns1` and `ns2`, respectively.
  * Both names can be resolved to A and AAAA via CNAME and give correct IP.

### CHILD-NS-CNAME-2
Zone is delegated to two IB NS, where both NS names are aliases (CNAME)
to other names out of zone.

* child.parent.child-ns-cname-2.methodsv2.xa
  * Zone is delegated to `ns1-cname` and `ns2-cname` and both are aliases to 
    `child-ns1.child-ns-cname-2.methodsv2.xa` and
    `child-ns2.child-ns-cname-2.methodsv2.xa`
  * Both names can be resolved to A and AAAA via CNAME and give correct IP.

### CHILD-NS-CNAME-3
Zone is delegated to two OOB NS, where both NS names are aliases (CNAME)
to other names out of zone.

* child.parent.child-ns-cname-3.methodsv2.xa
  * Zone is delegated to `ns3-cname.child-ns-cname-3.methodsv2.xa` and
    `ns4-cname.child-ns-cname-3.methodsv2.xa` and both are aliases to `ns3`
    and `ns4`, respectively.
  * Both names can be resolved to A and AAAA via CNAME and give correct IP.

### CHILD-NS-CNAME-4
Zone is delegated to two IB NS, where both NS names are aliases (CNAME)
to other names in zone.

* child.parent.child-ns-cname-4.methodsv2.xa
  * Zone is delegated to `ns1-cname` and `ns2-cname` and both are aliases to
    `ns1` and `ns2`, respectively.
  * Both names can be resolved to A via CNAME and give correct IP.
  * Neither name can be resolved to AAAA via CNAME.
  * The parent zone has glue records for `ns1-cname`, but not for `ns2-cname`.

### PARENT-NS-CNAME-1
Parent is delegated to two IB NS, where both NS names are aliases (CNAME)
to other names in parent zone.

* child.parent.parent-ns-cname-1.methodsv2.xa
  * Parent is delegated to `ns1-cname` and `ns2-cname` and both are aliases to
    `ns1` and `ns2`, respectively.
  * Both names can be resolved to A and AAAA via CNAME and give correct IP.

### PARENT-NS-CNAME-2
Parent is delegated to two IB NS, where both NS names are aliases (CNAME)
to other names out of zone.

* child.parent.parent-ns-cname-2.methodsv2.xa
  * Parent is delegated to `ns1-cname` and `ns2-cname` and both are aliases to 
    `parent-ns1.parent-ns-cname-2.methodsv2.xa` and
    `parent-ns2.parent-ns-cname-2.methodsv2.xa`
  * Both names can be resolved to A and AAAA via CNAME and give correct IP.
