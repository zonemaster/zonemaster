# Specification of test scenarios for MethodsV2

This document structure contains test scenario specifications for [MethodsV2],
which is not a Test Case module. Instead it is a collection of Method
specifications referred to by the Test Case specifications and implemented by
Perl methods used in the implementations of the Test Cases, respectively.

The purpose of the test scenarios for [MethodsV2] is to verify that the
implementation of the methods matches the specifications.

Test scenario specifications for the following methods are available:

* [Get parent NS IP addresses]
* [Get delegation NS names and IP addresses]
* [Get zone NS names and IP addresses]

Test scenarios specification:

* [Specification of test scenarios for MethodsV2](methodsv2.md)

Test scenarios for [Test Case] implementations and test scenarios for Perl
modules in Zonemaster-Engine are also not found in this structure. They are found
in sibling structures.
