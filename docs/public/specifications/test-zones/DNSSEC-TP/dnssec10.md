## Background

See the [test scenario README file].


## Test Case
This document specifies defined test scenarios for test case [DNSSEC10].


## Test scenarios

The purpose of the test scenarios is to cover all reasonable contexts where
different message tags are outputted when [DNSSEC10] is run on a test zone.
The message tags are defined in the test case ([DNSSEC10]) and the scenarios
are defined below.

The test scenarios are structured as stated in the [test scenario README file].

## Test zone names

The test zone or zones for each test scenario in this document is a subdomain
(or lower zone) delegated from the base name (`dnssec10.xa`) and that subdomain
having the same name as the scenario. The names of those zones are given in
section "[Test scenarios and setup of test zones]" below.


## All message tags
The test case can output any of these message tags, but not necessarily in any
combination. See [DNSSEC10] for the specification of the tags.

## Test scenarios and message tags

If a message tag is not listed for the scenario, its presence or non-presence is
irrelevant to the test scenario and must be ignored.

## Test scenarios and setup of test zones

### Default zone configuration
Unless otherwise specified in the specific scenario specification, the test zone
or zones for the scenario will follow the default setup as stated below. The
`child zone` is the zone to be tested for the scenario.

* The child zone is `SCENARIO.dnssec10.xa`.
  * It is delegated to two name servers, `ns1.SCENARIO.dnssec10.xa`
    and `ns2.SCENARIO.dnssec10.xa`.
    * The name server names have A and AAAA records to avoid non-relevant error
      messages.
    * The delegation of the child zone is complete with glue records.
  * There is a zone file for the child zone.
  * All child zone servers give the same response.
  * The responses are either with NSEC record (NSEC zone) or NSEC3 record (NSEC3
    zone), not mixed.
* The parent zone is `dnssec10.xa`.
  * It is served by two in-bailiwick NS (ns1 and ns2).
  * ns1 and ns2 have the same zone content.
  * ns1 and ns2 have both IPv4 and IPv6 glue.
  * The records matching glue in the zone are complete.
* If the child zone is an NSEC zone:
  * Responds with an NSEC response on the NSEC3PARAM query.
  * Responds with an NSEC record in answer section on the NSEC query.
* If the child zone is an NSEC3 zone:
  * Responds with an NSEC3 response on the NSEC query.
  * Responds with an NSEC3PARAM record in answer section on the NSEC3PARAM query.
* All responses will have the AA bit set.
* All responses will have the [RCODE Name] "NoError".

      an unsupported private algorithm.
    * A matching DNSKEY ([algorithm 255][IANA registry]) is available.
    * For this test scenario a fake signature and a fake public key are used.

    KSK.

* Zone: algo-not-supp-by-zm-2.dnssec10.xa

      an unsupported private algorithm.
    * A matching DNSKEY ([algorithm 255][IANA registry]) is available.
  * For this test scenario a fake signature and a fake public key are used.
  * The extra DNSKEY is in the DNSKEY RRset which is resigned by the valid
    KSK.

### ERR-MULT-NSEC-2
An NSEC zone. An extra NSEC record is returned on the NSEC query.
