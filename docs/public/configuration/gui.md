# Configuration

The GUI can be configured by creating the file
`DISTBASE/dist/assets/app.config.json`. "DISTBASE" is where the Zonemaster
Web GUI zip file is installed, which is `/var/www/html/zonemaster-web-gui` by
default installation (see [Installation instructions]).


This file can by created by copying `app.config.sample.json` found in
`DISTBASE/dist/assets`:
```sh
cp app.config.sample.json app.config.json
```


The supported configuration items are the following.

* `"apiEndpoint"`: The URL to use to contact the API, default `"/api"`.
  It could be either a full URL to use an API endpoint not located on the same
  origin as the one serving the GUI or just a path, like the default value, when
  both the API and GUI are served from the same origin.
* `"defaultLanguage"`: (*Deprecated*) This **does not** work anymore, to change
  the default language update the Apache configuration as mentioned in the
  [installation instructions][Default language].
* `"enabledLanguages"`: An array of the languages enabled in the GUI, default
  `[ "da", "en", "es", "fi", "fr", "nb", "sl", "sv" ]`.
* `"contactAddress"`: The contact email address displayed in the footer, default
  `"contact@zonemaster.net"`.
* `"logoUrl`": The URL to the image displayed in the navigation bar, default
  `"assets/images/zonemaster_logo_2021_color.png"`.
* `"msgBanner"`: A message to display to the user, if empty or undefined no
  banner will be shown. HTML formatting is supported (such as `<a>` tag) and
  some characters such as `&><` need to be written as HTML codes to be properly
  rendered.
* `"pollingInterval"`: Time between each test progress query in millisecond,
  default: `5000` (5 seconds).
* `"footerLogo"`: Optional logotype in the footer, default none (""), but else
  path to file.
* `"footerLogoAlt"`: Optional alternative text for the "footerLogo", only meaningful
  if "footerLogo" is defined. Typical "footerLogoAlt" is the name in "footerLogo".
