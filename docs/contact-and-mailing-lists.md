# Contact and Mailing lists

## Mailing lists

The Zonemaster project offer two public mailing lists with
different goals:

* zonemaster-announce
* zonemaster-users

### zonemaster-announce

The goal of `zonemaster-announce` is to provide a low-volume
mailing list for announcements from the Zonemaster project. Mainly
it is used to announce that a new Zonemaster release has been
published, but also to report on severe security problems.

The members of the list are not able to post any messages to the
list. This is for one-way communication only.

To sign-up on the list, go to
https://lists.iis.se/postorius/lists/zonemaster-announce.lists.iis.se/

### zonemaster-users

The goal of `zonemaster-users` is to provide a forum for discussions
between and questions from Zonemaster users. The users in this sense
are mainly those that have installed some part of the code. That
could either be for evaluation on a small virtual server or a
full-fledged installation of all parts for public use or anything
in between.

The members of the Zonemaster working group are also on list and can
reply to questions and participate in discussions.

The members of the list can post messages to the list, but those
must of course be relevant and respectful.

To sign-up on the list, go to
https://lists.iis.se/postorius/lists/zonemaster-users.lists.iis.se/

## Questions on problems with a domain name

If you have problem with your domain name, we can unfortunately not
help you solving the issue. Zonemaster can hopefully point out what
is wrong, but to have that issue resolved, you have to turn to
your DNS operator.

If Zonemaster does not report when there is a DNS error, or if
Zonemaster falsely reports an error, then we are very interested
to hear from you.

## Contacting the Zonemaster project

The best way to contact the Zonemaster project, besides using the
mailing list, is to create an issue in the Github issue tracker
for the Zonemaster repositories. That could be pure questions, but also
bug reports or suggestions for improvements.

* [Issues in Zonemaster::LDNS](https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster-ldns/issues)
* [Issues in Zonemaster::Engine](https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster-engine/issues)
* [Issues in Zonemaster::CLI](https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster-cli/issues)
* [Issues in Zonemaster::Backend](https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster-backend/issues)
* [Issues in zonemaster::GUI](https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster-gui/issues)

If you cannot determine which repository to create the issue in, please
select the main Zonemaster repository (i.e.
[general issues in Zonemaster](https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster/issues)).

If you cannot use any of the methods above, due to the subject matter, please
send an e-mail to zonemaster@zonemaster.net.
