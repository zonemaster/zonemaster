Zonemaster is a software package that validates the quality of a DNS delegation.
The ambition of the Zonemaster project is to develop and maintain an open source
DNS validation tool, offering improved performance over existing tools and providing
extensive documentation which could be re-used by similar projects in the future.

Zonemaster consists of several modules or components. The components will help
different types of users to check domain servers for configuration errors and
generate a report that will assist in fixing the errors.
