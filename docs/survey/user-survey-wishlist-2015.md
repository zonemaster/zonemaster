Wish List user survey for Zonemaster
=====================================

Background 
-----------

In order to identify and prioritise new features for zonemaster, a [user
survey](https://github.com/sandoche2k/zonemaster/blob/master/docs/survey/zonemaster-features-2015.md) was done with a list of features, which the zonemaster team felt was important. The survey was sent to:

   * dnsop@ietf.org
   * r_d@centrlists.org
   * tech@centrlists.org
   * members@dns-oarc.net
   * dns-operations@lists.dns-oarc.net
   * gtld-tech@icann.org


The user survey was performed between 2015-03-10 and 2015-04-06


Results
-------

There were overall 19 responses, and out of that, 11 responses were from people who
represented their organisations. The different organisations are : red.es,
PNINA, IEDR, NZRS, Premier Communications, ISNIC, Arnes, AM NIC, Andorra
Telecom, KLaM, NIC Chile.

Each 
[questionniare](https://github.com/sandoche2k/zonemaster/blob/master/docs/survey/zonemaster-features-2015.md)
had different categories from from "No" to "Must Have". 

As the objective of the survey is to identify the features most needed by the
user's external to the the team involved in developing Zonemaster, the result
below (Figure) concentrate on only two aspects from the response, i.e
the percentage of "Should Have" and "Must Have" for each question. 

The "X" axis points to the question number. The values in the "Y" axis represent the
percentage of respondants who thought that the feature (in the question) is a
"must have" or "should have".

But since "must have" carries more weight that than "should have", the
percentage values of "must have" is multiplied by "2" in the graph below

The figure 2 adds up the values of "must have" and "should have", thus providing
a pictorial representation of the priority for each feature.
