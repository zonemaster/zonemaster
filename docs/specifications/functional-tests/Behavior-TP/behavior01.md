## BEHAVIOR01: NXDOMAIN returned in response in the event of querying a domain name that does not exist

### Test case identifier

**BEHAVIOR01:** Name Error RCODE returned in response in the event of
querying a domain name that does not exist

### Objective 
Section 1 of [RFC 2308](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2308) mentions that
"NXDOMAIN" is an alternation expression of the "Name Error" RCODE as described
in section 4.1.1 of [RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035).

This test is to verify whether the engine responds with a RCODE NXDOMAIN when
querying a domain name that does not exist.

### Inputs

The domain to be tested. The domain should not be already delegated in the DNS.

### Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. A standard query for the domain is made (zonemaster-cli afnics.fr)
2. If the query don’t receive an RCODE NXDOMAIN, the test returns with FAIL

### Outcome(s)

If the test does not return FAIL, then the engine does not capture the correct
RCODE in the event of testing a non existant domain name

### Special procedural requirements	

None

### Intercase dependencies

None
