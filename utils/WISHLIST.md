# WishList for future version

1.  Multiple points of checking - Should be able to run tests from different end points and get the results and fusion together into one result
2.  Structured output of the result and/or a library to run the tool
    from another program (the library may be useful even if the tool has a
    structured output).
3.  Developing a Mobile app
4.  Parallel tests
5.  It would be nice to test if unknown RR types can be queried (Ref :
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?36909)
